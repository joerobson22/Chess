Chess!

Currently only local 1v1, but I aim to add a simple bot you can play against soon.

Usage:
1. Install all files into a folder somewhere
2. Nagivate to said folder
3. If you're on a UNIX system, you can just run __make -B__. Otherwise, as long as you've got JDK installed, you can do __javac *.java__ and then __java Main__ to run
